# herdr-auto-update

A [herdr](https://herdr.dev) plugin that checks your installed plugins for newer
upstream commits and reinstalls them - if you opt in. Since v1.0 the default
`policy` is `notify`: updates are detected and reported, but never installed
automatically. Set `policy = "auto"` (or `"pinned-only"`) in the plugin
config to enable automatic reinstalls. Runs as a herdr plugin action and as a
standalone CLI.

herdr plugin v1 has no dedicated `plugin update` command, so this plugin
performs the update as a reinstall (`herdr plugin install <owner>/<repo>`),
which replaces the managed checkout while preserving plugin config and state.

## Features

- Checks every GitHub-installed plugin against its upstream ref (via
  `git ls-remote`) and reinstalls the outdated ones. Plugins installed with
  `herdr plugin install --ref` keep their pin: they are compared and
  reinstalled against that same ref, never moved to `HEAD`.
- Ref channels are explicit: branch / tag / commit pins are classified
  (`channel:` in `plan` output, `ref_kind` in JSON). Commit-pinned plugins
  are immutable by construction - the pin is the installed commit, so they
  are never reinstalled and never hit the network.
- Remote checks run in parallel under a bounded worker pool
  (`max_concurrency`, default 8), so the check time is one network round trip
  regardless of how many plugins are installed.
- Every remote check has a hard wall-clock deadline (`timeout_secs`, default
  20): a wedged git process is killed, so a dead network cannot hang herdr
  startup.
- Automatic check + reinstall at herdr server startup (toggleable).
- Desktop notification when updates ran (`herdr notification show`,
  toggleable).
- Manual actions: `check` / `update` (bind keys in your herdr config).
- Standalone CLI with human and `--json` output and scriptable exit codes,
  including `--only <plugin_id>` to target a single plugin.
- `exclude` list for plugins you do not want touched.
- Update policy: `auto` (reinstall), `notify` (report only, never install;
  the default since v1.0), `pinned-only` (update only pinned plugins), plus
  `allow` owner/repo globs. A one-line stderr note is printed while `policy`
  is unset.
- Dry-run `plan` command and explicit `apply`, both scriptable via `--json`.
- Live progress panel on terminals: an animated per-plugin view (spinner,
  ✓/✗, and an overall progress bar) while checks and updates run. Auto-
  disabled for piped output and `--json`, so herdr logs and scripts see the
  same stable line-based report as before.
- Human-readable version transitions in reports (`v1.0.1 -> v1.0.2`): the
  installed version comes from the plugin manifest, the upstream version
  from the newest release tag. Plugins without versions fall back to commit
  SHAs.
- Linux, macOS, and Windows support; Rust binary with argv-based subprocess
  calls (no shell interpolation).

## Requirements

- herdr >= 0.7.0
- `git` on PATH (used for the upstream check; herdr's own plugin install also
  requires it)
- `curl` on PATH (used to classify update direction via the GitHub compare
  API; when unavailable every changed plugin is reported as `unknown`)
- `gh` CLI or `curl` for the launcher's first-run binary download (Linux and
  macOS also need `tar`; Windows 10+ ships `tar` and `curl`)

## Install

```bash
herdr plugin install dio16/herdr-auto-update
```

No Rust toolchain is required: the manifest's `[[build]]` steps are not
compilation — they install the standalone CLI shim — and the `bin/` launcher
downloads the versioned prebuilt binary for your platform from GitHub
Releases on first use, verifying its SHA256 checksum before running it. The
binary is cached in `bin/.cache/`.

If the plugin is already registered from a local dev checkout
(`herdr plugin link`), install from GitHub fails with
`plugin ... is already linked from a local path`. Unlink it first, then
install:

```bash
herdr plugin unlink herdr-auto-update
herdr plugin install dio16/herdr-auto-update
```

Enable the actions you want in `~/.config/herdr/config.toml`
(or `%APPDATA%\herdr\config.toml` on Windows):

```toml
[[keys.command]]
key = "prefix+u"
type = "plugin_action"
command = "herdr-auto-update.update"
description = "Update herdr plugins"
```

On Windows the action ids are suffixed with `-windows`
(`herdr-auto-update.update-windows`, `herdr-auto-update.check-windows`) because
herdr requires action ids to be unique within a plugin. `herdr plugin action
list` prints the exact ids for your platform.

## Configuration

The plugin reads `config.toml` from its plugin config directory (created by
herdr on install; print the path with `herdr plugin config-dir
herdr-auto-update`). When herdr runs the plugin it injects the directory via
env vars; a standalone `herdr-auto-update` run resolves the same directory
through `herdr plugin config-dir`, so shell invocations and herdr's own
startup hook always read the same config:

```toml
# Reinstall outdated plugins automatically at server startup (default true).
auto_update = true

# Show a desktop notification when updates ran (default true). Notifications
# are suppressed when --json is used.
notify = true

# Plugin ids to skip during updates.
exclude = ["flock.farm"]

# Hard wall-clock deadline for each upstream check (git ls-remote), in
# seconds (default 20). Kills a wedged git process so herdr startup cannot
# hang on a dead network connection.
timeout_secs = 20

# Upper bound on concurrent upstream checks (default 8). Registry-wide runs
# never spawn more git processes than this.
max_concurrency = 8

# Update policy (default "notify" since v1.0): what update/apply/startup may
# do with a plugin whose upstream ref changed.
#   "auto"        - reinstall outdated plugins automatically
#   "notify"      - check, report, and notify only; never install
#   "pinned-only" - reinstall only plugins installed with a pinned --ref
# v0.x users: an unset policy now defaults to "notify" (no automatic
# reinstalls) and prints a one-line stderr note. Set `policy = "auto"` below
# to keep the v0.x automatic-update behavior.
policy = "auto"

# Restrict update targets to owner/repo glob patterns (default: all GitHub
# plugins). `*` matches any sequence (including `/`), `?` one non-`/` char.
# allow = ["ragamo/*", "dio16/herdr-*"]

# Only fast-forward updates are ever applied (default true). Classification
# enforces this: `behind` (installed is an ancestor of upstream) is the only
# status that updates; `ahead` / `diverged` / `unknown` are held.
require_fast_forward = true

# Allow installing a diverged upstream (history rewritten by a force push).
# Default false: diverged plugins are held until you decide.
allow_force_push = false

# Only auto-update plugins whose GitHub owner is in this list (default:
# empty = any owner). Use to whitelist trusted plugin authors.
# trusted_owners = ["dio16", "ragamo"]

# Hold tag- and commit-pinned plugins (default true): their pin is treated as
# immutable, so only branch-tracked plugins are ever auto-updated.
# immutable_pins = true
```

## CLI

When herdr runs the plugin it injects `HERDR_BIN_PATH` and runs the command
from the plugin root, so the launcher always finds the binary. For standalone
use the `herdr-auto-update` executable must be on PATH: either
`cargo install --path .` from a checkout (installs into `~/.cargo/bin`), or
add the plugin's `bin/` directory (which contains the downloaded binary under
`.cache/`) to PATH.

### Check for updates

`herdr-auto-update check` — report which GitHub-installed plugins have an
upstream ref (HEAD or the pinned ref) that differs from the installed commit.
Exits `1` when updates are available, `2` when any plugin check errored, `0`
otherwise.

```bash
herdr-auto-update check
```

### Check with JSON output

`herdr-auto-update check --json` — same check, machine-readable output as a
JSON array of plugin statuses (one object per plugin with `plugin_id`, `owner`,
`repo`, `version`, `installed_sha`, `remote_sha`, `update_available`, `status`
(`same`/`behind`/`ahead`/`diverged`/`unknown`), `ref_kind`
(`branch`/`tag`/`commit`), `requested_ref`, `error`).

`status` is classified via the GitHub compare API (`installed...upstream`):
`behind` = upstream has commits you lack (updateable), `ahead` = you have
commits upstream lacks, `diverged` = both sides have unique commits (force
push), `unknown` = classification failed (network/rate limit) — degraded to
the safe side (never auto-updated).

```bash
herdr-auto-update check --json
```

### Update plugins

`herdr-auto-update update` — reinstall every outdated plugin through
`herdr plugin install`. Exits `1` when one or more reinstalls failed, `2` when
any plugin check errored (successfully checked plugins are still updated in
that case). Shows a notification when updates ran (unless `notify = false`).

```bash
herdr-auto-update update
```

### Plan (dry run)

`herdr-auto-update plan` — analyze only, execute nothing: prints the status,
policy, and action (`UPDATE`/`HOLD`/`ERROR`) for every plugin. `plan --json`
emits the same as machine-readable JSON. Exits `1` when updates would apply,
`2` when any plugin check errored, `0` otherwise.

```bash
herdr-auto-update plan
herdr-auto-update plan --json
```

### Apply

`herdr-auto-update apply` — execute the plan's `UPDATE` actions only (identity
with `update`; both exist so scripts can name the phase they mean).

```bash
herdr-auto-update apply
```

### Update one plugin

`herdr-auto-update update --only <plugin_id>` — restrict check/update to a
single plugin id. An id that is not in the registry, or not a GitHub-installed
plugin, is a fatal error (exit `2`).

```bash
herdr-auto-update update --only flock.farm
```

### Startup hook

`herdr-auto-update startup` — what herdr runs at server startup: check and
reinstall outdated plugins per the configured `policy`, unless
`auto_update = false` in the config. Not meant to be run by hand.

```bash
herdr-auto-update startup
```

### Update history

Every applied update is recorded in `state.json` inside the plugin config
directory (append-only; the latest entry per plugin is the rollback target).
`herdr-auto-update history` prints the audit trail; `history --json` emits it
machine-readable.

Updates install the exact upstream commit verified by the plan. Before
installing, local state preserves the original branch, tag, or default-HEAD
tracking ref. Later checks restore that channel only when the plugin id,
source repository, installed commit, and registry SHA pin match. If tracking
state cannot be saved, installation is blocked.

```bash
herdr-auto-update history
herdr-auto-update history --json
```

### Roll back an update

`herdr-auto-update rollback` — reinstall each plugin at the commit recorded
before its **most recent** update (`herdr plugin install <owner>/<repo>
--ref <previous-sha>`), using state. Older history is never rewound: an
A→B→C trail rolls back to B, not to A. `rollback --only <plugin_id>`
restricts the target. Plugins without a recorded previous commit are
reported as failures; a plugin that is already rolled back is left alone.
Rollback and resume return nonzero if any target fails, including partial success.

Rolling back pin installs the previous commit, so herdr records it as a
commit pin (`--ref <sha>`). By design that **quarantines** the plugin: it is
no longer auto-updated, and `plan` marks it "pinned by rollback". To rejoin
the tracking ref (branch or default) that was recorded before the rollback,
run `resume` — it reinstalls from that ref and the plugin becomes an
auto-update candidate again.

```bash
herdr-auto-update rollback
herdr-auto-update rollback --only herdr-file-viewer
herdr-auto-update resume
herdr-auto-update resume --only herdr-file-viewer
```

Every rollback and resume is appended to `state.json`, so `history` shows
the full trail: `updated` → `rolled_back` → `updated`.

### Pinned plugins (commit pins)

A plugin manually installed with a commit SHA is **pinned to a commit**:
it is never auto-updated (the pin IS the installed commit). `check`/`plan`
show `channel: commit`, and `update`/`startup` report it as `pinned` (JSON
report field, stderr summary, and desktop notification) instead of silently
listing it as up to date.

This happens after a `rollback` (rejoin with `resume`) and for installs that
were pinned to a specific commit. To update a commit-pinned plugin, run
`herdr-auto-update untrack --only <plugin_id>` explicitly: it clears the pin
and reinstalls from the default branch. Update, apply, and startup never
clear pins or install held entries, even interactively.

`check`/`update` lead every plugin line with a status word that states the
outcome explicitly: `✓ No changes needed` (green — nothing to do), `✓ Updated`
(green — a change was applied), `⚠ Update available` (yellow — attention),
`ℹ Pinned` (cyan — not auto-updated), `✗ Error` / `✗ Update failed` (red).
"Updated" is used only when something actually changed; a bare "up to date"
is avoided because it reads like an action. Colors reinforce the words and
are enabled only on a terminal (`NO_COLOR` or `TERM=dumb` disables them);
piped and `--json` output never contains escape codes, and the symbols +
words carry the meaning in monochrome. The summary is one line per run
(`checked 4, updated 0, failed 0, held 0, pinned 0, errors 0`), colored
green / yellow / red by the worst outcome, plus a note when
`policy = "notify"` held updates (reported, never installed).

### Common flags

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--json` | machine-readable output (check/update; suppresses notifications) |
| `--config <path>` | override the plugin config file |
| `--only <plugin_id>` | restrict check/update/rollback/resume to one plugin id; required by `untrack` |
| `-V, --version` | print the version |
| `-h, --help` | print help |

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | ok / everything up to date |
| `1` | updates available (check), updates would apply (plan), one or more reinstalls failed (update/startup), or nothing to roll back / resume |
| `2` | fatal error, bad usage, or one or more plugin checks errored; `untrack` misuse or a plugin that is not commit-pinned |

## Development

```bash
herdr plugin link /path/to/herdr-auto-update   # local dev registration
cargo build --release
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
cargo test
```

With a local `target/release/herdr-auto-update` present, the `bin/` launcher
runs that build directly (no download); without it, the launcher downloads the
versioned prebuilt binary for your platform from GitHub Releases, verifying
its SHA256 checksum (release assets: `herdr-auto-update-<version>-<triple>.tar.gz`
+ `checksums-<version>.txt`, built by `.github/workflows/release.yml` on tag
pushes). The dev launchers `scripts/run.sh` / `scripts/run.ps1` remain for
cargo-built installs.

Installation runs a small post-install hook that puts `herdr-auto-update` on
your PATH (`~/.local/bin/herdr-auto-update`, set `XDG_BIN_HOME` to override;
Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\WindowsApps\herdr-auto-update.cmd`), so
`herdr-auto-update check` works from a shell right away. The shim is a small
self-resolving script (it locates the plugin via `herdr plugin list`), so it
survives reinstalls; remove it when uninstalling the plugin.

To be listed in the herdr marketplace, add the `herdr-plugin` topic to the
repository on GitHub (the index refreshes automatically).

## Security notes

- All subprocess execution uses argv arrays; plugin ids, owners, and repos
  from the registry are validated (`[A-Za-z0-9._-]`, length-bounded) before
  being placed into URLs or arguments.
- The plugin never evaluates shell code; subprocesses are `git`, `curl`, and
  herdr's own installer. The only files it writes are `state.json` and
  `compare-cache.json` in herdr's plugin config directory (needed for
  rollback and rate-limit-safe classification).
- Prebuilt binaries are downloaded from the `dio16/herdr-auto-update`
  GitHub release matching the pinned version and verified against the
  release's SHA256 checksum before execution. The binary is cached under
  `bin/.cache/` (gitignored). The `bin/` launcher falls back to a local
  `cargo build --release` when present, so `herdr plugin link` dev setups
  never download anything.
- Dependencies are minimal (`serde`, `serde_json`, `toml`), pinned by
  `Cargo.lock` for the binary.
